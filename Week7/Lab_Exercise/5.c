Given an array of n integers, rearrange them so that the sum of the absolute differences of all adjacent elements is minimized. Then, compute the sum of those absolute differences. Example n = 5 arr = [1, 3, 3, 2, 4] If the list is rearranged as arr' = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4], the absolute differences are |1 - 2| = 1, |2 - 3| = 1, |3 - 3| = 0, |3 - 4| = 1. The sum of those differences is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3. Function Description Complete the function minDiff in the editor below. minDiff has the following parameter: arr: an integer array Returns: int: the sum of the absolute differences of adjacent elements Constraints 2 ≤ n ≤105 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109, where 0 ≤ i < n Input Format For Custom Testing The first line of input contains an integer, n, the size of arr. Each of the following n lines contains an integer that describes arr[i] (where 0 ≤ i < n) . Sample Case 0 Sample Input For Custom Testing STDIN Function ----- -------- 5 → arr[] size n = 5 5 → arr[] = [5, 1, 3, 7, 3] 1 3 7 3 Sample Output 6 Explanation n = 5 arr = [5, 1, 3, 7, 3] If arr is rearranged as arr' = [1, 3, 3, 5, 7], the differences are minimized. The final answer is |1 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 5| + |5 - 7| = 6. Sample Case 1 Sample Input For Custom Testing STDIN Function ----- -------- 2 → arr[] size n = 2 3 → arr[] = [3, 2] 2 Sample Output 1 Explanation n = 2 arr = [3, 2] There is no need to rearrange because there are only two elements. The final answer is |3 - 2| = 1.
